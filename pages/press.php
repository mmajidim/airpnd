            <p>Founded in 2015 and headquartered in Boulder, Colorado, we at AirPnD are inspired to build a sharing community with social responsibility. We encourage airport travelers giving rides to other travelers who need rides from airports to home and vice versa to fill up their empty seats in private vehicles. This will reduce traffic congestion, reduce carbon emission, save money on gas, save money on airport parking and build a network of carpooling communities.
