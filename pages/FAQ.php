                    <p>
                        Ride sharing or carpooling is pre-organised hitchhiking where drivers offer rides to riders along the route they already plan to travel. Riders and drivers travel together to share the cost of gas, they would contact each other before the journey, and agreeing on meeting points, drop-off points, and cost contributions.
